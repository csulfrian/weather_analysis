## Data Details

The data spans the one year period from July 1 2014 to June 30 2015. It includes the following data:
- actual min, max, and mean temperature
- average min, max, and mean temperature
- record min, max, and mean temperature
- the year the record min or max temperature occured
- actual, average, and record precipitation amounts

from the following cities:
- Charlotte, NC
- Houston, TX
- Jacksonville, FL
- New York, NY
- Phoenix, AZ
- Cincinatti, OH
- Indianapolis, IN
- Chicago, IL
- Philadelphia, PA
- Seattle, WA

## Goal

I wanted to explore the occurrence of record temperature days, both high and low. We're all familiar with the fact that the world is getting warmer overall, but how do record temperatures on individual days tie in with this?
